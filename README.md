This is a helper script to create Arch Linux ISO's that support
Offline installations. It requires root privileges due to archiso itself.

Usage:

	sudo python offline.py

Arguments:

	--template=<archiso template name>
	  Defines which archiso template to adapt into a offline version.
	  The default is: releng

	--mirrors=<region>
	  Uses the current HTTPS enabled mirrors from this region.

	--packages="<list of packages>"
	  A space separated list of packages to ship with the iso
	  aside from the default packages in archiso packages.x86_64

	--rebuild
	  Cleans and re-creates the builddir and other dependencies

	--breakpoint
	  Creates a breakpoint right before mkarchiso is executed.
	  This way you can do manual changes to the ISO layout before
	  mkarchiso is executed.

	--repo=<repo name>
	  You can override the repository name created inside the ISO.
	  The default is: localrepo

	--builddir=<path to folder>
	  You can override the build directory for the ISO.
	  The default is: ./archiso_offline/

	--verbose
	  Enables printout for all the syscalls that are being made.
	  (For instance output from mkarchiso)

	--boot
	  Boots the built ISO, either after --rebuild or old build.

	--archinstall
	  Clones in archinstall master branch and adds it to autostart.
	  (This is optional, archinstall stable is shipped as a package already)

	--ai-branch=<archinstall branch to clone>
	  This can override the default `master` branch.

	--profiles=[a commaseparated list of profile paths]
	  If a profile is given, it is copied into archinstall master directory.
	  This option implies --archinstall is given.

	--aur-packages="<list of AUR packages>"
	  A space separated list of AUR packages that will be built and
	  shipped within the ISO mirror as a standard package.

	--aur-user=username
	  Set a build-user username, if this user does not exist it will be
	  created. If the user does not have an entry in /etc/sudoers an entry
	  will be created with NOPASSWD only if the user is locked on the local system.
	  (the AUR user will be deleted as well as the /etc/sudoers entry unless pre-configured)

Examples:

	sudo python offline.py --mirrors=Sweden --packages="nano wget" --rebuild
